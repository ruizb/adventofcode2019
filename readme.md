# Advent of code 2019

This repository is used to solve puzzles from [Advent of code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019), mainly by using the [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/) library.

It's the opportunity for me to practice some functional programming in Typescript.

## Requirements

The only requirement to run this project is [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Using `nvm use` at the root of the repository, you can install the appropriate Node version with the `npm` command used to install the dependencies and run the project.

## Build

```sh
npm run build
```

## Run

Requires to build the project first.

```sh
node lib/dayX/
```

(replace `X` with the desired day number)

## Tests

I'll add some when I get the chance.
